Sprint 2

User stories:
1. Redesigned and developed login and register functionality using JWT token authentication.
2. Travel guides can add tour pacakages
3. Users can add/view and edit details on their profile.



Backend:

Travel guides can add tour packages which will have the following details:
GuideEmail   
Duration     
Location     
Accomodation
Itinerary    
Included
    
A new table called Package is created with the above details. The email id which they provide on the tour package needs to exist in our system. Also,
the travel guide needs to be registered in our system as one, meaning, a person registered as tourist cannot add a tour package. If a person wants to d
act as both tourist and travel guide, they have to register with each of these roles. These cases have been handled in the code and returns errors.

Unit Testing for SearchPlaces api (implemented in Sprint 1) has been done. Following cases has been handled:
1. When search string=""
2. When search string doesnot match any valid place name
3. When search string matches a valid place name
4. When search string is similar to a valid place name but not exactly same.
5. When search string= " "

jwt tokenization backend:
jwt tokenization is done using the user given mail and user role fields. there are two types of tokens: 
access token and refresh token. Access token is checked whenever user tries to access the authenticated rotes.
refresh token is used to refresh the token for user covinience, as the access token will expire in shorter time. 
The metadata will be stored in redis middleware. whenever a user logout, the token will be removed from the middleware .
